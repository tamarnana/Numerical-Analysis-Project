This repository is part of the academic course **Numerical Analysis** in the B.Sc. program at **Shamoon College of Engineering (SCE)**.

This project focuses on the analysis and optimization of software development performance using statistical models.
It demonstrates how numerical methods can be applied to build and evaluate a defect‑prediction model for software systems via mathematical equations. 
The system accepts input data and generates graphical visualizations of the analysis results.
